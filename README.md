# Partition Sector Calculator

This script allows users to input a starting sector and a partition size in MB, then calculates the range of sectors that the partition will occupy.

## 5W1H: Understanding the Project

### Who:
Designed for anyone, from students to professionals, needing to calculate sector ranges for disk partitions.

### What:
A Python tool that calculates the range of sectors a partition will occupy based on a starting sector and size in MB.

### When:
Useful for disk partitioning tasks, forensics, or understanding the relationship between megabytes and disk sectors.

### Where:
Runs on any system with Python installed, including personal computers, servers, and online platforms supporting Python scripting.

### Why:
While partitioning tools exist, understanding the underlying calculations is crucial. This script offers a direct, clear solution.

### How:
Execute the desired version and follow on-screen prompts. The output indicates the starting and ending sectors for the specified partition size.

## Versions:
